With this hands-on book, you can master the fundamentals of the core Python language quickly and efficiently, whether you're new to programming or just new to Python. Once you finish, you will know enough about the language to use it in any application domain you choose. Learning Python is based on material from author Mark Lutz's popular training courses, which he's taught over the past decade. Each chapter is a self-contained lesson that helps you thoroughly understand a key component of Python before you continue. Along with plenty of annotated examples, illustrations, and chapter summaries, every chapter also contains Brain Builder, a unique section with practical exercises and review quizzes that let you practice new skills and test your understanding as you go. This book covers: Types and Operations -- Python's major built-in object types in depth: numbers, lists, dictionaries, and more Statements and Syntax -- the code you type to create and process objects in Python, along with Python's general syntax model Functions -- Python's basic procedural tool for structuring and reusing code Modules -- packages of statements, functions, and other tools organized into larger components Classes and OOP -- Python's optional object-oriented programming tool for structuring code for customization and reuse Exceptions and Tools -- exception handling model and statements, plus a look at development tools for writing larger programs Learning Python gives you a deep and complete understanding of the language that will help you comprehend any application-level examples of Python that you later encounter.

Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences from ABC, C, Modula-3 and Icon. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C. Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba, the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but as the examples are self- contained, the tutorial can be read off-line as well. For a description of standard objects and modules, see the Python Library Reference manual.

Muirhead, Michael Foord', \"In 2005, Microsoft quietly announced an initiative to bring dynamic languages to the .NET platform. The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework. IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming. IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it's a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and duck typing , metaprogramming, and more. IronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors provide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning.

Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor.

Muirhead, Michael Foord', \"In 2005, Microsoft quietly announced an initiative to bring dynamic languages to the .NET platform. The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework. IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming. IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it's a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and duck typing , metaprogramming, and more. IronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors provide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more.

Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor.

In the beginner's book, you learned some of the basic functions of Python and the various pieces of code that you are going to be able to input into Python so that you can make that function work properly. However, in this book, you are going to learn about other functions and pieces of the code that will work with the functions that you already know. It is here that you are going to be taking another step towards being able to program your own applications, websites, and anything else that you could possibly want to program all with simple blocks of code that you learned from a beginner's book. Do not rush into thinking that you are going to be able to write your own computer application just yet. That is going to require that you get through this book and the next one to get a complete understanding of how Python works. The intermediate level is going to be a level that you may think does not need to be explored because some of it may end up being completely irrelevant to what it is that you are going to do with Python.

C H Swaroop, James Zimmerhoff', 'The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, [1] and its implementation was started in December 1989[2] by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC (programming language) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[3] Van Rossum is Python\\'s principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).[4][5] Python was named for the BBC TV show Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus.[6] Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.[7] Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008[8] after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.[9] In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.[10] Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of list, dict, str and so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as \"one of Python\\'s major programming units.\"[1] Python\\'s exception model also resembles Modula-3\\'s, with the addition of an else clause.[3] In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python\\'s userbase.[1] Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce. Van Rossum stated that \"Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches.\"[11] The last version released while Van Rossum was at CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Van Rossum continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia whence he released several versions. By version 1.4, Python had acquired several new features. Notable among these are the Modula-3 inspired keyword arguments (which are also similar to Common Lisp\\'s keyword arguments) and built-in support for complex numbers. Also included is a basic form of data hiding by name mangling, though this is easily bypassed.[12] During Van Rossum\\'s stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic \"literacy\" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E\\'s goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA.[13] As of 2007, the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, reaching out to non-programmers is not an active concern.[14] Here are what people are saying about the book: This is the best beginner\\'s tutorial I\\'ve ever seen!

The creator of this programming language was Guido Van Rossum, released first in the year 1991. The multiple supporting programming paradigms made itself unique from other programming languages as it had some outstanding features like unique adaptability, the ability to adopt machine learning, scientific computation, cloud infrastructure and above all web development. Python's role is really commendable in both software development, as well as, web development. This book is helpful for learning everything Python has to offer.By connecting with a database system Python can read and modify files. To create workflows in Software, this language is helpful. Python also supports a dynamic type system, automatic memory management, object-oriented and structured programming. Moreover, this programming language has the potential to support the various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. Where the other programming languages use semicolon or parentheses to complete a command, Python uses new lines to complete it. Python Coding and Programming Python is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on the code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook. It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc, and those languages hire Python designs for their development. Linux for beginners For computers, servers, mainframes, mobile, and embedded devices, Linux is an open-source and community-developed and operating system. As it is an open source OS, the code is free to create Linux. That's why the appropriate skills for the users are necessary, even if they are beginners, so that they can get the best out of the operating system. This is not only used by the web programmers but also by the regular computer or laptop users and even mobile phones . Get hold of the eBook to learn more. As it is a bit different from the popular operating system like Windows or Android, it takes a little bit of time to get the hang of it. The most important thing about Linux that it is free. It is really hard to hack into Linux as it is highly secured. For different types of users, there are different flavors and the available flavors are called 'distributions'.

Despite the show\\'s very English humor and allusions to many things British, the series developed a cult following outside the U.K., particularly in the United States. Known for its outrageous humor, occasionally controversial content, and often silly spirit, Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus poked fun at nearly all institutions—domestic or foreign, grand or intimate, sacred or not. Indeed, many of the allusions and references in the program were uniquely British and routinely obscure, and therefore, not always understood or even noticed outside the British Isles.

The Pythons converged on Tunisia to film their timeless classic, Life of Brian, and Howard found himself in the thick of it, doubling for nearly all the Pythons, playing more roles in the film than John Cleese, and managing to ruin only one shot. He became the unit journalist, substitute still photographer, Roman soldier, peasant, Biggus Dickus\\'s double, near-stalker, and, ultimately, friend and confidant of the comedy legends. He also kept a detailed journal of what he saw and heard, on set and off, throughout those six weeks. The result is a unique eyewitness account that reveals the Pythons at work and at play in a way that nothing else written about them could do. Now, for the first time ever, the inside story of the making of the film is revealed through the fly-on-the-castle-wall perspective.

The first part of this book motivates the entire topic and highlights major challenges, trends and design criteria for log data analysis approaches, and further surveys and compares the state of the art. The second part of this book introduces concepts that apply character-based, rather than token-based, approaches and thus work on a more fine-grained level. Furthermore, these solutions were designed for “online use”, not only forensic analysis, but also process new log lines as they arrive in an efficient single pass manner. An advanced method for time series analysis aims at detecting changes in the overall behavior profile of an observed system and spotting trends and periodicities through log analysis. The third part of this book introduces the design of the AMiner, which is an advanced open source component for log data anomaly mining. The AMiner comes with several detectors to spot new events, new parameters, new correlations, new values and unknown value combinations and can run as stand-alone solution or as sensor with connection to a SIEM solution. More advanced detectors help to determines the characteristics of variable parts of log lines, specifically the properties of numerical and categorical fields. Detailed examples throughout this book allow the reader to better understand and apply the introduced techniques with open source software. Step-by-step instructions help to get familiar with the concepts and to better comprehend their inner mechanisms. A log test data set is available as free download and enables the reader to get the system up and running in no time. This book is designed for researchers working in the field of cyber security, and specifically system monitoring, anomaly detection and intrusion detection. The content of this book will be particularly useful for advanced-level students studying computer science, computer technology, and information systems. Forward-thinking practitioners, who would benefit from becoming familiar with the advanced anomaly detection methods, will also be interested in this book.', 'ISBN_13ISBN_10', 1, 1, 210, 'Computers', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F-Q_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'FOR_SALE', 1, 11764.6, 'INR', 11764.6, 'INR', 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F-Q_EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', '2021', 'Springer Nature')\n",

Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them.

Paul Ferrill leads you from installing the Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) to writing small scripts, to more complicated and interesting projects, and finally to uploading and packaging your programs to an Android device. Android runs scripts in many scripting languages, but Python, Lua, and Beanshell are particularly popular. Most programmers know more than one programming language, so that they have the best tool for whatever task they want to accomplish. Pro Android Python with SL4A explores the world of Android scripting by introducing you to the most important open-source programming languages that are available on Android-based hardware. Pro Android Python with SL4A starts by exploring the Android software development kit and then shows you how to set up an Eclipse-based Android development environment. You then approach the world of Android programming by using Beanshell, which runs on the Dalvik, and learning how to write small programs to administer an Android device. Next, discover how Lua, a lightweight language perfectly suited for scripting on smaller devices, can work with Android. Lua can be used for small but important tasks, like SMS encryption and synchronizing photos with flickr. Last, but certainly not least, you will discover the world of Python scripting for SL4A, and the power contained within the full range of Python modules that can combine with the Android SDK. You'll learn to write small location-aware apps to get you started, but by the end of this book, you'll find yourself writing fully GUI-fied applications running on the Android desktop!

By showing how to combine the high-level elegance, accessibility, and flexibility of Python, with the low-level computational efficiency of C++, in the context of interesting financial modeling problems, they have provided an implementation template which will be useful to others seeking to jointly optimize the use of computational and human resources. They document all the necessary technical details required in order to make external numerical libraries available from within Python, and they contribute a useful library of their own, which will significantly reduce the start-up costs involved in building financial models. This book is a must read for all those with a need to apply numerical methods in the valuation of financial claims.\" –David Louton, Professor of Finance, Bryant University This book is directed at both industry practitioners and students interested in designing a pricing and risk management framework for financial derivatives using the Python programming language. It is a practical book complete with working, tested code that guides the reader through the process of building a flexible, extensible pricing framework in Python. The pricing frameworks\\' loosely coupled fundamental components have been designed to facilitate the quick development of new models. Concrete applications to real-world pricing problems are also provided. Topics are introduced gradually, each building on the last. They include basic mathematical algorithms, common algorithms from numerical analysis, trade, market and event data model representations, lattice and simulation based pricing, and model development. The mathematics presented is kept simple and to the point.

If you’ve been curious about artificial intelligence and machine learning but didn’t know where to start, this is the book you’ve been waiting for. Focusing on the subfield of machine learning known as deep learning, it explains core concepts and gives you the foundation you need to start building your own models. Rather than simply outlining recipes for using existing toolkits, Practical Deep Learning teaches you the why of deep learning and will inspire you to explore further. All you need is basic familiarity with computer programming and high school math—the book will cover the rest. After an introduction to Python, you’ll move through key topics like how to build a good training dataset, work with the scikit-learn and Keras libraries, and evaluate your models’ performance. You’ll also learn: How to use classic machine learning models like k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines How neural networks work and how they’re trained How to use convolutional neural networks How to develop a successful deep learning model from scratch You’ll conduct experiments along the way, building to a final case study that incorporates everything you’ve learned. The perfect introduction to this dynamic, ever-expanding field, Practical Deep Learning will give you the skills and confidence to dive into your own machine learning projects.', 'ISBN_13ISBN_10', 0, 0, 463, 'Computers', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TSEXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 0.0, 'N/A', 'http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TSEXEAAAQBAJ&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api', '2021', 'No Starch Press')\n",

Until the early 1990s, when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, travelling behind the iron curtain was never easy. In undertaking his new journey through Eastern Europe, breathing in its rich history, and exquisite sights and talking to its diverse peoples, Michael fills what has been a void in his own experience and that of very many others. NEW EUROPE is very much a voyage of discovery, from the snows of the Julian Alps to the beauty of the Baltic sea, he finds himself in countries he'd barely heard of, many unfamiliar and mysterious, all with tragic histories and much brighter futures. During his 20-country adventure Palin meets Romanian lumberjacks, drives the 8.58 stopping train from Poznan to Wolsztyn, treads the catwalk at a Budapest fashion show, learns about mine-clearing in Bosnia and watches Turkish gents wrestling in olive oil. As with all his bestselling books, in his uniquely entertaining style, Palin opens up a new and undiscovered world to millions of readers.\", 'ISBN_13ISBN_10', 1, 0, 335, 'Travel', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PVvtdxosLYYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'FOR_SALE', 1, 600.62, 'INR', 300.31, 'INR', 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PVvtdxosLYYC&source=gbs_api', '2010', 'Hachette UK')\n",

The outrage over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, published in 1988, highlighted our continued uneasiness over distinctions between fact and fiction, novel and history, truth and falsehood. The blasphemy charged against Rushdie raises important questions: Did Rushdie mean The Satanic Verses, or didn't he? When he publicly recanted, what did he mean? What do we even mean by mean? This is the starting point for Richard Henry's fascinating investigation of the pragmatic foundations of fictional discourse. Drawing from Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature, Henry offers a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts. Pretending and Meaning: Toward a Pragmatic Theory of Fictional Discourse draws upon Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature to offer a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts.\", 'OTHER', 0, 0, 152, 'History', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wws0AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 0.0, 'N/A', 'http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Wws0AAAAMAAJ&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api', '1996', 'Praeger')\n",

By virtue of its mysterious movement, potent poison, fearful grip, unblinking gaze and lightning quick strike, the power and image of the snake has wound its way into every culture. Whether snakes are worshipped as gods, feared as devils, or handled in religious ceremonies to test faith, snakes have played a critical role in the human heritage. This book explores the cult of the snake in world history, religion, and folklore. Fascination with snakes has been around since the dawn of time. Even today, images of snakes attract attention, fear, disgust, or admiration. Morgan examines that obsession with this mysterious creature, covering in vivid details such topics as mythical snakes like the Plumed Serpent, serpent iconography, tall tales, as well as the psychological symbolism that has attached itself to snakes. Cultures as diverse as pre-Columbian America, India, Egypt, China, sub-Saharan Africa, Celtic Europe, and the United States have all accorded the serpent a special place in their culture—apparently regardless of whether or not real snakes play an important part in the life of the people.

This completely updated guide clearly explains concepts such as introspection, overriding built-ins, extending Perl\\'s object-oriented model, and testing your code for greater stability. Other topics include: Complex data structures Parsing Templating toolkits Working with natural language data Unicode Interaction with C and other languages In addition, this guide demystifies once complex topics like object-relational mapping and event-based development-arming you with everything you need to completely upgrade your skills. Praise for the Second Edition: \"Sometimes the biggest hurdle to problem solving isn\\'t the subject itself but rather the sheer number of modules Perl provides. Advanced Perl Programming walks you through Perl\\'s TMTOWTDI (\"There\\'s More Than One Way To Do It\") forest, explaining and comparing the best modules for each task so you can intelligently apply them in a variety of situations.\" --Rocco Caputo, lead developer of POE \"It has been said that sufficiently advanced Perl code is indistinguishable from magic. This book of spells goes a long way to unlocking those secrets. It has the power to transform the most humble programmer into a Perl wizard.\" --Andy Wardley \"The information here isn\\'t theoretical. It presents tools and techniques for solving real problems cleanly and elegantly.\" --Curtis \\'Ovid\\' Poe \" Advanced Perl Programming collects hard-earned knowledge from some of the best programmers in the Perl community, and explains it in a way that even novices can apply immediately.\" --chromatic, Editor of Perl.com', 'OTHER', 0, 0, 316, 'Computers', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RbBQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 0.0, 'N/A', 'http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RbBQAAAAMAAJ&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api', '2005', \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\")\n",

By virtue of its mysterious movement, potent poison, fearful grip, unblinking gaze and lightning quick strike, the power and image of the snake has wound its way into every culture. Whether snakes are worshipped as gods, feared as devils, or handled in religious ceremonies to test faith, snakes have played a critical role in the human heritage. This book explores the cult of the snake in world history, religion, and folklore. Fascination with snakes has been around since the dawn of time. Even today, images of snakes attract attention, fear, disgust, or admiration. Morgan examines that obsession with this mysterious creature, covering in vivid details such topics as mythical snakes like the Plumed Serpent, serpent iconography, tall tales, as well as the psychological symbolism that has attached itself to snakes. Cultures as diverse as pre-Columbian America, India, Egypt, China, sub-Saharan Africa, Celtic Europe, and the United States have all accorded the serpent a special place in their culture—apparently regardless of whether or not real snakes play an important part in the life of the people.

The pytest testing framework helps you write tests quickly and keep them readable and maintainable - with no boilerplate code. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it's just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing for applications, packages, and libraries. This book shows you how. For Python-based projects, pytest is the undeniable choice to test your code if you're looking for a full-featured, API-independent, flexible, and extensible testing framework. With a full-bodied fixture model that is unmatched in any other tool, the pytest framework gives you powerful features such as assert rewriting and plug-in capability - with no boilerplate code. With simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn and robust tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing. Add powerful testing features and still speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use the built-in assert statements to reduce false test failures by separating setup and test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, unittest, and doctest. Write simple, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing and why. What You Need: The examples in this book are written using Python 3.6 and pytest 3.0.

Being able to transform a theory into an algorithm requires significant theoretical insight, detailed physical and mathematical understanding, and a working level of competency in programming. This upper-division text provides an unusually broad survey of the topics of modern computational physics from a multidisciplinary, computational science point of view. Its philosophy is rooted in learning by doing (assisted by many model programs), with new scientific materials as well as with the Python programming language. Python has become very popular, particularly for physics education and large scientific projects. It is probably the easiest programming language to learn for beginners, yet is also used for mainstream scientific computing, and has packages for excellent graphics and even symbolic manipulations. The text is designed for an upper-level undergraduate or beginning graduate course and provides the reader with the essential knowledge to understand computational tools and mathematical methods well enough to be successful. As part of the teaching of using computers to solve scientific problems, the reader is encouraged to work through a sample problem stated at the beginning of each chapter or unit, which involves studying the text, writing, debugging and running programs, visualizing the results, and the expressing in words what has been done and what can be concluded. Then there are exercises and problems at the end of each chapter for the reader to work on their own (with model programs given for that purpose).', 'ISBN_13ISBN_10', 0, 1, 644, 'Science', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zCLyCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 0.0, 'N/A', 'http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zCLyCQAAQBAJ&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api', '2015', 'John Wiley & Sons')\n",

I\\'ve been a database programmer and engineer for more than 15 years, working at top organizations like Expedia, Microsoft, T-Mobile, and the Gates Foundation. In 2015, I was teaching a SQL Server Certificate course at the University of Washington Continuing Education. It was a 10 week course, and my students paid more than $1000 for it. My students learned the basics of SQL, most of the keywords, and worked through practice problems every week of the course. But because of the emphasis on getting a broad overview of all features of SQL, we didn\\'t spend enough time on the types of SQL that\\'s used 95% of the time--intermediate and advanced Select statements. After the course was over, some of my students emailed me to ask where they could get more practice.

Database performance has become a major headache, and most IT departments believe that developers should provide simple SQL code to solve immediate problems and let DBAs tune any bad SQL later. In The Art of SQL, author and SQL expert Stephane Faroult argues that this safe approach only leads to disaster. His insightful book, named after Art of War by Sun Tzu, contends that writing quick inefficient code is sweeping the dirt under the rug. SQL code may run for 5 to 10 years, surviving several major releases of the database management system and on several generations of hardware. The code must be fast and sound from the start, and that requires a firm understanding of SQL and relational theory. The Art of SQL offers best practices that teach experienced SQL users to focus on strategy rather than specifics. Faroult's approach takes a page from Sun Tzu's classic treatise by viewing database design as a military campaign. You need knowledge, skills, and talent. Talent can't be taught, but every strategist from Sun Tzu to modern-day generals believed that it can be nurtured through the experience of others. They passed on their experience acquired in the field through basic principles that served as guiding stars amid the sound and fury of battle. This is what Faroult does with SQL. Like a successful battle plan, good architectural choices are based on contingencies. What if the volume of this or that table increases unexpectedly? What if, following a merger, the number of users doubles? What if you want to keep several years of data online? Faroult's way of looking at SQL performance may be unconventional and unique, but he's deadly serious about writing good SQL and using SQL well. The Art of SQL is not a cookbook, listing problems and giving recipes. The aim is to get you-and your manager-to raise good questions.\", 'ISBN_13ISBN_10', 0, 1, 369, 'Computers', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I0iBAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 0.0, 'N/A', 'http://books.google.co.in/books?id=I0iBAgAAQBAJ&dq=sql&hl=&source=gbs_api', '2006', '\"O\\'Reilly Media, Inc.\"')\n",

Using the framework of the data life cycle, it focuses on the steps that are very often given the short shift in traditional textbooks, like data loading, cleaning and pre-processing. The book is organized as follows. Chapter 1 describes the data life cycle, i.e. the sequence of stages from data acquisition to archiving, that data goes through as it is prepared and then actually analyzed, together with the different activities that take place at each stage. Chapter 2 gets into databases proper, explaining how relational databases organize data. Non-traditional data, like XML and text, are also covered. Chapter 3 introduces SQL queries, but unlike traditional textbooks, queries and their parts are described around typical data analysis tasks like data exploration, cleaning and transformation. Chapter 4 introduces some basic techniques for data analysis and shows how SQL can be used for some simple analyses without too much complication. Chapter 5 introduces additional SQL constructs that are important in a variety of situations and thus completes the coverage of SQL queries. Lastly, chapter 6 briefly explains how to use SQL from within R and from within Python programs. It focuses on how these languages can interact with a database, and how what has been learned about SQL can be leveraged to make life easier when using R or Python. All chapters contain a lot of examples and exercises on the way, and readers are encouraged to install the two open-source database systems (MySQL and Postgres) that are used throughout the book in order to practice and work on the exercises, because simply reading the book is much less useful than actually using it. This book is for anyone interested in data science and/or databases. It just demands a bit of computer fluency, but no specific background on databases or data analysis.

Using the framework of the data life cycle, it focuses on the steps that are very often given the short shift in traditional textbooks, like data loading, cleaning and pre-processing. The book is organized as follows. Chapter 1 describes the data life cycle, i.e. the sequence of stages from data acquisition to archiving, that data goes through as it is prepared and then actually analyzed, together with the different activities that take place at each stage. Chapter 2 gets into databases proper, explaining how relational databases organize data. Non-traditional data, like XML and text, are also covered. Chapter 3 introduces SQL queries, but unlike traditional textbooks, queries and their parts are described around typical data analysis tasks like data exploration, cleaning and transformation. Chapter 4 introduces some basic techniques for data analysis and shows how SQL can be used for some simple analyses without too much complication. Chapter 5 introduces additional SQL constructs that are important in a variety of situations and thus completes the coverage of SQL queries. Lastly, chapter 6 briefly explains how to use SQL from within R and from within Python programs. It focuses on how these languages can interact with a database, and how what has been learned about SQL can be leveraged to make life easier when using R or Python. All chapters contain a lot of examples and exercises on the way, and readers are encouraged to install the two open-source database systems (MySQL and Postgres) that are used throughout the book in order to practice and work on the exercises, because simply reading the book is much less useful than actually using it. This book is for anyone interested in data science and/or databases. It just demands a bit of computer fluency, but no specific background on databases or data analysis.

Covering the latest Oracle release, Oracle Database 11gR2, Feuerstein has rewritten this new edition in the style of his bestselling Oracle PL/SQL Programming. The text is organized in a problem/solution format, and chronicles the programming exploits of developers at a mythical company called My Flimsy Excuse, Inc., as they write code, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes-and each other. This book offers practical answers to some of the hardest questions faced by PL/SQL developers, including: What is the best way to write the SQL logic in my application code? How should I write my packages so they can be leveraged by my entire team of developers? How can I make sure that all my team\\'s programs handle and record errors consistently? Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices summarizes PL/SQL best practices in nine major categories: overall PL/SQL application development; programming standards; program testing, tracing, and debugging; variables and data structures; control logic; error handling; the use of SQL in PL/SQL; building procedures, functions, packages, and triggers; and overall program performance. This book is a concise and entertaining guide that PL/SQL developers will turn to again and again as they seek out ways to write higher quality code and more successful applications. \"This book presents ideas that make the difference between a successful project and one that never gets off the ground.

These new, in-memory structures differ from caching mechanisms of the past, and make possible the extraordinarily swift execution of certain types of queries such as are used in business intelligence applications. Beginning SQL Server for Developers helps you realize the promises of this new feature set while avoiding pitfalls that can occur when mixing in-memory tables and code with traditional, disk-based tables and code. Beginning SQL Server for Developers takes you through the entire database development process, from installing the software to creating a database to writing the code to connect to that database and move data in and out. By the end of the book, you’ll be able to design and create solid and reliable database solutions using SQL Server.

The second part explores data query techniques, such as row filtering, joins, single-row functions, aggregate functions, subqueries, and views. Several advanced query topics, such as ROLLUP, CUBE, and TOP-N analysis, are also introduced. To help students bridge these SQL topics to further studies, appendixes introduce SQL tuning, compare Oracle’s SQL syntax with other databases (MS SQL Server and MySQL), and explain how to embed SQL in applications (ASP.NET).

This second edition covers PostGIS 2.0 and 2.1 series, PostgreSQL 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 features, and shows you how to integrate with other GIS tools. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Book Processing data tied to location and topology requires specialized know-how. PostGIS is a free spatial database extender for PostgreSQL, every bit as good as proprietary software. With it, you can easily create location-aware queries in just a few lines of SQL code and build the back end for a mapping, raster analysis, or routing application with minimal effort. PostGIS in Action, Second Edition teaches you to solve real-world geodata problems. It first gives you a background in vector-, raster-, and topology-based GIS and then quickly moves into analyzing, viewing, and mapping data. You'll learn how to optimize queries for maximum speed, simplify geometries for greater efficiency, and create custom functions for your own applications. You'll also learn how to apply your existing GIS knowledge to PostGIS and integrate with other GIS tools. Familiarity with relational database and GIS concepts is helpful but not required.

We have taken tons of interviews and most of the interviews are not revolving around how deep technical and internals you know about the subject - but it revolves around how good you are with the basics.To clear an interview, one doesn\\'t need to know inside-out of a subject, and subjects like \"SQL Server\" so vast that every single day we learn something new with this product, and even a complete lifetime will fly off if we keep doing this. Again, the various roles one can get into for products like SQL Server are from Database Developer, Database Modelers, Database Architect, Database Administrator and many more. Hence, this book is geared towards demystifying and a refresher for memories on the fundamentals which sometimes are the most important things to clear any type of interview for any role. Some of the concepts discussed are generic and are not tied to any specific version of SQL Server, but most of it the new features introduced with SQL Server have been included in this book.This book is not a shortcut or a sure to crack interview guide but this book gets you prepared in an organized manner.

Once you get an understanding of concepts, then if we are twisted with the concept in a scenario it becomes easy to solve them. Most companies have a typical way to do interviews which are based on the scenario as per their environment and these are just combinations of the concepts to fit their need and SLA.Though each of these chapters is bucketed for convenience we highly recommend reading each of the sections nevertheless irrespective of the roles you might be doing as each of the sections have some interesting trivia\\'s working with SQL Server.

It is one of the most sought after and simple programming languages of our age.SQL is lost behind a crowd of other, more popular programming languages such as C++, Python, Java etc. There are many people who have used SQL and discarded its legitimacy as a programming language simply because of its user friendly interface and a limited number of functions. However, all true computer wiz's must know that no matter how developed and advanced third level programming languages such as C++ and Python are, it doesn't change the fact that SQL is also a programming language - a very resourceful one at that.SQL has a wide range of functionality that includes quering, retrieving and extracting information from relational databases and so on. Moreover, the ability of SQL to create structure based relational databases such as tables and views has made it extremely popular among major companies such as Microsoft. Because of its compatible nature, and easy to use interface, the demand for SQL is booming rapidly around the world. A person who is adept at working on SQL can also work on other languages such as MySQL etc., because of its compatible nature. SQL is compatible to fill the requirements as needed by several companies which have several database management and development in their list of agendas. It is also extremely useful when it comes to creating reports, business and data analysis and programming.Here are a few advantages of learning SQL: -It is relatively easier to learn, and creates vast career opportunities. -SQL is slowly and gradually forming a solid place within various companies that need to organize their database. Having knowledge of SQL can help you get into these companies.The demand for SQL is still at large, as it caters to many fields such as database management and development. Moreover, it plays a fundamental role in activities such as creating reports, business and data analysis, and of course, computer programming.If you think SQL is a dying language, then reconsider. Here are a few reasons why it is not: -Knowledge of SQL creates opportunities for diverse career options-The corporate world is using SQL to keep track of their database, meaning having knowledge of SQL is a helpful trait when it comes to finding jobs-Helps you understand the origins of programming languages and overall sense of computer programming.DOWNLOAD: SQL Coding For Beginners, an essential tool for developers using SQL statements for controlling and modifying tables, and an intermediate level guide for learning SQL programming step by step.The SQL language still burns bright and is being used by a large number of local businesses and corporations. They use this simple and easy to understand and operate language to keep tab of their company's database. Therefore, it would be extremely beneficial to have a basic knowledge about this language.The goal of the e-Book is simple: To help beginners start on their journey to learn SQL coding in a simple and easy manner.You will also learn: -Basics of SQL-How to install SQL developers-Working with data, tables, and columns-SQL Security-SQL Injections-Pivoting data in SQLWould you like to know more?Download the eBook, SQL Coding For Beginners to learn how to use SQL quickly and efficiently.Scroll to the top of the page and select the buy now button.\", 'ISBN_10ISBN_13', 0, 0, 200, 'N/A', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_QcwzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 0.0, 'N/A', 'http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_QcwzQEACAAJ&dq=sql&hl=&source=gbs_api', '2020', 'Not available')\n",

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” — Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” — Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” — Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” — John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” — Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” — Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” — Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” — Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . .

PL/SQL is a programming language providing procedural extensions to the SQL relational database language and to an ever-growing number of oracle development tools. originally a rather limited tool, PL/SQL became with Oracle7 a mature and effective language for developers. now, with the introduction of Oracle8, PL/SQL has taken the next step towards becoming a fully realized programming language providing sophisticated object-oriented capabilities. Steven Feuerstein's Oracle PL/SQL Programming is a comprehensive guide to building applications with PL/SQL. That book has become the bible for PL/SQL developers who have raved about its completeness, readability, and practicality. Built-in packages are collections of PL/SQL objects built by Oracle Corporation and stored directly in the Oracle database. The functionality of these packages is available from any programming environment that can call PL/SQL stored procedures, including Visual Basic, Oracle Developer/2000, Oracle Application Server (for web-based development), and, of course, the Oracle database itself. Built-in packages extend the capabilities and power of PL/SQL in many significant ways. for example: DBMS_SQL executes dynamically constructed SQL statements and PL/SQL blocks of code. DBMS_PIPE communicates between different Oracle sessions through a pipe in the RDBMS shared memory. DBMS_JOB submits and manages regularly scheduled jobs for execution inside the database. DBMS_LOB accesses and manipulates Oracle8's large objects (LOBs) from within PL/SQL programs. The first edition of Oracle PL/SQL Programming contained a chapter on Oracle's built-in packages. but there is much more to say about the basic PL/SQL packages than Feuerstein could fit in his first book. In addition, now that Oracle8 has been released, there are many new Oracle8 built-in packages not described in the PL/SQL book. There are also packages extensions for specific oracle environments such as distributed database. hence this book. Oracle Built-in Packages pulls together information about how to use the calling interface (API) to Oracle's Built-in Packages, and provides extensive examples on using the built-in packages effectively. The windows diskette included with the book contains the companion guide, an online tool developed by RevealNet, Inc., that provides point-and-click access to the many files of source code and online documentation developed by the authors.

Teaches many about aspects about SQL server that are not widely known. A complete tutorial to conducting SQL Server investigations and using that knowledge to confirm, assess, and investigate a digital intrusion. Companies today are in a terrible bind: They must report all possible data security breaches, but they don't always know if, in a given breech, data has been compromised. As a result, most companies are releasing information to the public about every system breech or attempted system breech they know about. This reporting, in turn, whips up public hysteria and makes many companies look bad. Kevvie Fowler's 'SQL Server Forensic Analysis' is an attempt to calm everyone down and focuses on a key, under-documented component of today's forensics investigations. The book will help investigators determine if a breech was attempted, if information on the database server was compromised in any way, and if any rootkits have been installed that can compromise sensitive data in the future. Readers will learn how to prioritize, acquire, and analyze database evidence using forensically sound practices and free industry tools.

But with so many distributed databases and tools available today, it’s often difficult to understand what each one offers and how they differ. With this practical guide, Alex Petrov guides developers through the concepts behind modern database and storage engine internals. Throughout the book, you’ll explore relevant material gleaned from numerous books, papers, blog posts, and the source code of several open source databases. These resources are listed at the end of parts one and two. You’ll discover that the most significant distinctions among many modern databases reside in subsystems that determine how storage is organized and how data is distributed. This book examines: Storage engines: Explore storage classification and taxonomy, and dive into B-Tree-based and immutable Log Structured storage engines, with differences and use-cases for each Storage building blocks: Learn how database files are organized to build efficient storage, using auxiliary data structures such as Page Cache, Buffer Pool and Write-Ahead Log Distributed systems: Learn step-by-step how nodes and processes connect and build complex communication patterns Database clusters: Which consistency models are commonly used by modern databases and how distributed storage systems achieve consistency', 'ISBN_13ISBN_10', 0, 1, 373, 'Computers', 'en', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-l2vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 0, 0.0, 'N/A', 0.0, 'N/A', 'http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-l2vDwAAQBAJ&dq=sql&hl=&source=gbs_api', '2019', \"O'Reilly Media\")\n",

This revised and updated edition takes the same approach as the highly-acclaimed first edition. The text concentrates on the description of commonly-used experiments and explains in detail the theory behind how such experiments work. The quantum mechanical tools needed to analyse pulse sequences are introduced set by step, but the approach is relatively informal with the emphasis on obtaining a good understanding of how the experiments actually work. The use of two-colour printing and a new larger format improves the readability of the text. In addition, a number of new topics have been introduced: How product operators can be extended to describe experiments in AX2 and AX3 spin systems, thus making it possible to discuss the important APT, INEPT and DEPT experiments often used in carbon-13 NMR. Spin system analysis i.e. how shifts and couplings can be extracted from strongly-coupled (second-order) spectra. How the presence of chemically equivalent spins leads to spectral features which are somewhat unusual and possibly misleading, even at high magnetic fields. A discussion of chemical exchange effects has been introduced in order to help with the explanation of transverse relaxation. The double-quantum spectroscopy of a three-spin system is now considered in more detail.

Finally, it describes how to use various software tools to create user interfaces to review and update data in a database. Organized into 11 chapters, the book begins with an overview of the functionality of database management systems and how they guarantee the accuracy and availability of data. It then describes how to define and normalize data requirements to create a logical data model, then map them into an initial solution for a physical database. The book next presents how to use an industry-leading data modeling tool to define and manage logical and physical data models. After that, it describes how to implement a physical database using either Microsoft Access or SQL Server and how to use Microsoft Access to create windows interfaces to query or update data in tables. The last part of the book reviews software tools and explores the design and implementation of a database using as an example a much more complex data environment for a University.

It's the first book specifically focused on the Apple Watch's most important function: health and fitness. This book is for you if you are interested in health and are willing to make small lifestyle adjustments in order to enhance health and well-being. This book is also for you if you are a dedicated health junkie who already exercises on a regular basis and follows a healthy diet. The Apple Watch includes fitness apps that you can access right on your wrist while you are exercising, for instant feedback on how you are doing. You will learn how to use the Watch to avoid sitting for too long, to register a healthy amount of body movement every day, and how to get the most out of more strenuous exercise activities. All fitness and exercise-related built-in apps will be covered in detail, as well as leading third party health and fitness apps that have been specifically tailored to work with the Watch. Part I plus two appendixes give readers just what they need to know to understand all functionality of the Apple Watch to set up their Apple Watch, and what third-party apps are available (at time of publication). It's a great mini-book that will be appeal to readers who don't feel the need to buy an entire standalone introduction to the Apple Watch. Part II (the majority of the book) clearly explains the Apple Watch's fitness an d health-tracking functions, but goes well beyond this by showing readers different ways to integrate these functions into their daily lives, regular workout routines, and with their iPhone and the leading third-party health and fitness apps. Plus, there's an entire chapter devoted to the Apple Watch Research Kit, explaining the benefits of the associated medical research apps and how users can participate in these world-changing programs, should they choose to.

Over the course of a week, the naïve and dreamy girl finds herself quickly betrothed and married, and is soon living in Brooklyn.

But her grandmother is firm on the matter: the only way to secure a worthy future for Deya is through marriage to the right man.
